# OSGiDoc(WIP) #

OSGiDoc is documentation utility that helps generating a _html_ based documentation for OSGi bundles. This serves as first step words building a formal RFP to the OSGi Alliance on defining the documentation as part of the OSGi specification.

### What is this repository for? ###

* The OSGiDoc tool has two main parts,
